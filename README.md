DALTB is a joint effort among five students aimed at comparing the load times of different applications on various devices. The team runs a consistent set of applications multiple times on each device, using automation tools like PyAutoGUI or pywinauto to simplify the process. They record the average load time for each application on each device, then analyze the data to gain insights into how applications perform on different devices.
